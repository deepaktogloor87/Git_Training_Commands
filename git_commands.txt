Git RESET and REVERT
RESET - Partially, user can think of it as a "RollBack"
 * Reset points local env back to a previous commit.

REVERT - Net effect of the git revert command is similar to reset, but its approach is different.
 * Revert adds a new commit at the end of the chain to "cancel" changes.

6. git log --oneline - will basically gives you all logs unique id.

7. Git reset --soft <logid> : revert the commit history.

8. Git reset --hard <logid> : revert the history and changes are recently being done in the file or DISCOMMIT.

9. Git revert HEAD : will basically revert the report commit. And create new log id with changes

10. Git Diff : will show changes made what in which files.
